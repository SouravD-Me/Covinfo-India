## About

<div align="justify">
Covinfo India is the final year project of four B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering students. 
This project is developed using Python 3.7.7 along with the packages for data analytics and visualization. 
This project started with analyzing the dataset by collecting credible Covid-19 data from WHO Covid-19 dashboard for the latest case statistics in India, 
and Arogya Setu smartphone app for collecting the overall vaccination data in India. Finally, we embedded our data visulizations in a website using Matplotlib, HTML and CSS.

## Objective
  
<div align="justify">

It is practically evident that the second wave of chaos that the corona Virus (Covid-19) has thrust India and the World into. This project helps to gain a sense of war has transpired until now, using data analysis techniques. The fundamental building block of the project is _**Python associated with Pandas, Plotly, and on top of that HTML5 and CSS for Front-End Design**_. It can be derived without saying that an incident of such a large statue has already attracted a plethora of research works. Hence, this web-based project will provide the necessary information this information and analyze the details as to make it easier for people to reach out for help.

The goal is to create a web application that updates the covid-19 case data on app launch & shows the data on a web dash board. <br>

### Features:	
•	Download and parsing of officially available data (from [_**Who India**_](https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/in) and the [_**Indian Council of Medical Research**_](https://www.icmr.gov.in/)) on the corona virus. <br>
•	Options to choose from official [_**CoWIN**_](https://www.cowin.gov.in/) approved vaccination centers as vaccination venues. <br>
•	Plot showing new and cumulated case statistics of the _**Selected States, Confirm cases, Cured cases and Deceased cases**_.
